# Kendra's Portfolio

## Description

- I was motivated to learn aspects of CSS while putting it into action including but not limited to: flexboxes, pseudo-classes and media queries.
- I built this project to develop more skills and understanding of advanced css.
- I was able to create a professional portfolio where I can easily update the images, links and description of future projects.
- I learned how to utilize flexboxes, how to layout a webpage that is accessible for desktop, mobile and tablet users.
